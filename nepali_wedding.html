<p>What happens during a Nepali wedding, in detail, is often a bit of a mystery to everyone but the priests officiating the wedding. Below are the main events that happen during the wedding, in rough order.</p>

<h2>Janti &#8212; The procession</h2>

<p>In Nepal, weddings are often held at the bride&#8217;s house, or in the bride&#8217;s village. The party that proceeds from the groom&#8217;s house to the bride&#8217;s is known as the &#8220;Janti.&#8221; This procession / party often involves a vehicle (or multiple), a band that leads the way, though sadly no horse (that is more common in some states of India). For the miribhas wedding, the Janti will be a bit light, since most people will be in PA the night before already.</p>

<h2>Saipata &#8212; The advance party</h2>

<p>An advance party from the groom&#8217;s side go first into the wedding venue, to announce the arrival of the group.  They bring fruits, nuts, and some auspicious items; the bridal group who is at the venue already welcomes them with flowers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilaka">red tika</a>. The group will then go out and uhser in the rest of the groom&#8217;s party. </p>

<h2>Swayamvar &#8212; The bride&#8217;s choice</h2>

<p>In Sanskrit, <em>Swayam</em> means self, and <em>var</em> means choice. During the Swayamvar, the bride puts a garland around the groom to declare that he is her choice for a husband. The groom in turn puts a garland around the bride. In Nepali weddings, the garland is a special garland made of grass.</p>

<h2>Ganesh Puja &#8212; The first worship</h2>

<p>Ganesh, among the Hindu gods, is a remover of obstacles. He will be worshipped to begin the wedding.</p>

<h2>Goda dhune &#8212; Foot washing</h2>

<p>The bride&#8217;s extended family washes the bride and groom&#8217;s feet, as well as blesses them with tika. Traditionally, after the foot washing, the bride and groom change into clothes presented by the family of the partner. We will skip this changing step.</p>

<h2>[SKIPPED] Kanya daan &#8212; Giving away of the bride</h2>

<p>Generally, at this point, there is a ceremony where the bride&#8217;s parents &#8220;give away the bride&#8221; to the groom. We will be skipping this ceremony, as we find this event&#8217;s treatment of women as property an outdated notion (to put it gently).</p>

<h2>Wedding Worship &#8212; The significance of fire</h2>

<p>All throughout, wedding worship takes place around a fire. Space (&#8220;ether&#8221;), air, fire, water, and earth are all the five &#8220;great&#8221; elements (PanchaMahaBhoot) in Hinduism. However, fire holds special signficance; because Hindus are cremated, the wedding worship around the fire denotes that the bonds created around this fire can only be undone by fire itself (after death).</p>

<h2>Lagan &#8212; Offering of the beaded necklace</h2>

<p>The groom offers the bride a tilahari (or Pote), a green beaded necklace that can only be worn by married women. Wedding guests clap, as this is one of the milestones (one of many) that signifies a wedded couple.  </p>

<h2>Lagan Gatho, Mangalphera, and Havan &#8212; The wedding knot, circling the fire</h2>

<p>The bride and groom are united by a long cloth that is tied around them. The bride leads the way as the bride and groom circle the fire, representing their journey through life. The bride and groom take <a href="http://weddings.iloveindia.com/indian-weddings/seven-vows.html">seven vows</a>. Our favorite is the last one, in which the couple promise to be companions and best friends for life.</p>

<h2>Sindoor &#8212; Vermillion</h2>

<p>Vermillion is another mark of a married Nepali woman. The groom applies vermillion to the bride&#8217;s forehead and welcomes her as his wife.</p>

<h2>Dai Chataune, Pasa Khelne, Dori Tanne &#8212; Yogurt feeding, Gambling, Tug of War</h2>

<p>During the wedding, at the behest of the priest, the bride and groom may be asked to feed yogurt to each other (or according to Miriam, each other&#8217;s faces), play a gambling game, and for the bride and groom&#8217;s families to engage in some games of tug of war. Traditional Nepali weddings can last 10s of hours, so these events add <code>light</code> elements to what can be a long process.</p>
